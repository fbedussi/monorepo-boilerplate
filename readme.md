# How to handle packages in a monorepo with Lerna, Typescript, Vite, React and Node

## 1. Crete the monorepo

`npx lerna init``

## 2. Add packages

### 2.1 Create the package

Add each package under the `packages` folder, treat it as if it were an indipendent application: with its own src folder, package.json and all the usual stuff (`npm init` to bootstrap)

### 2.2 Configure the package.json file

#### 2.2.1 The name field

In the `name` field specify the package name (usually the same as the folder name).

#### 2.2.3 The dependencies

If the package uses other packages in the monorepo, add them under the dependencies/devDependencies key with this syntax:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "model": "*",
    "helpers": "*",
    ...
}
```

The key is the `name` field in the dependency's package.json.

#### 2.2.4 The entrypoints

Add the right entrypoints, e.g.

```json
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "types": "build/index.d.ts",
```

they must point to the correct files generated by the build script.

#### 2.2.5 The scripts

To be able to run the npm scripts from Lerna make sure that every package has the same basic scripts, e.g.: build, start (or dev) and test.

To simplify the Lerna configuration male sure that every package has the same build folder name.

### 3. Configure TypeScript

- add the tsconfig.json file
- in the tsconfig.json file add

```json
    "paths": {
      "model": ["../model"],
      "helpers": ["../helpers"]
    },
```

listing all the packages's dependencies, the key is the `name` field in the dependency's package.json.

### 4. Install the dependencies

`npm i`

### 5. Start the project

`npx lerna run start`

### 6. Build the project

`npx lerna run build`

### 7. Install a dependency in a package

`npm install nodemon --workspace=back-end`

### 8. Use ESM both on node and on front-end

If the front end was bootstrapped with vite + react it is already configured to use ESM.

To configure node packages to use ESM:

in package.json add:

```json
  "type": "module",
  "exports": "./build/index.js",
```

in tsconfig.json add:

```json
  "target": "ESNext",
```

Now the build stript should work.

To enable esm with nodemon add a nodemon.json file with this content:

```json
{
  "execMap": {
    "ts": "ts-node --esm"
  }
}
```
